    <h2>Metamorphosis</h2>
    <p>
      Verily, I once was a mere reflection <br>
      Of all that I cherished, pure and true <br>
      My spirit danced to the joyous beat <br>
      Of a life lived in innocence, bright and dew
    </p>
    <p>
      But gradually, as the sands of time shifted <br>
      I found myself slowly changing hue <br>
      What once was light, now seemed so dark <br>
      A sinister shadow, I grew into
    </p>
    <p>
      My once gentle heart now filled with disdain <br>
      For all that I once held so dear <br>
      A disdain born of disillusionment <br>
      And a bitterness that festered year by year
    </p>
    <p>
      And as I looked into the mirror each day <br>
      I beheld a visage I could not recognize <br>
      The person I once was, now lost to time <br>
      Replaced by this monster, a mere disguise
    </p>
    <p>
      The metamorphosis complete, I was no more <br>
      The person I once was, forever gone <br>
      In its stead, a fiend of malice and sorrow <br>
      Whose heart was filled with malevolent song
    </p>
    <p>
      And as I stand here, a shell of what once was <br>
      I wonder at the path that led me here <br>
      To a place where I loathe the very being <br>
      That I have become, a soul so full of fear
    </p>
    <p>
      And so I ponder, if redemption is possible <br>
      Or if I am doomed to an eternal night <br>
      Where the only solace is the comfort <br>
      Of embracing the thing I once thought I'd fight.

    <p>
      She was a storm wrapped in skin, <br>
      with lightning in her veins, and thunder in her heart.
